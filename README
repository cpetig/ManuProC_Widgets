These are those parts of Komponenten's main library which are of 
interest to a wider user group.

This library contains:

- SimpleTree: a widget which interactively transforms a linear list 
	into a tree and displays it
- more Model/View/Controller like Widgets for gtkmm2

and perhaps more.

I apologize for not documenting them up to now and (of course) these 
classes have a long history so they sometimes start to smell ...

Use them, improve them, share them.
